# GMTK 2022 - CheekyDice

> üèÜ Rank 293/6106 (top 5%)

This is the repository for my [GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022) 2022 submission. The theme this year was "Roll of the Dice" and the game I created is called [CheekyDice](https://danyatesdev.itch.io/cheekydice).

CheekyDice is a top-down game where you play as a die trying to knock as many items off a table as possible. The more things you knock off, the more points you score. But beware, the humans are trying to knock you off too!

This game was created in 48 hours using the Unity game engine. Everything for this game was created during this 48h game jam period (3D assets, sounds, code, UI designs, artwork, etc.)
